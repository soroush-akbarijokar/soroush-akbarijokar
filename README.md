# Hi, I'm Soroush ;)

PhD candidate in Operations Research @ Pitt. I build scalable algorithms for inverse optimization, reinforcement learning, and clustering with applications to VRP and production planning.

## Featured Repositories

- **Optimality-Based Clustering** — stability + column-generation (manuscript in prep)  
  ➜ https://github.com/soroush-akbarijokar/optimality-based-clustering

- **Inverse MIP for VRP** — convex inverse approx (manuscript in prep)  
  ➜ https://github.com/soroush-akbarijokar/inverse-mip-vrp

- **Causal & Graphical Models (CMU 10-701)** — small, didactic project connecting Bayesian networks to causal estimands (ATE); includes back-door & front-door identification, IPW/AIPW, EM for missing mediator, sweeps, tests, and CI  
  ➜ https://github.com/soroush-akbarijokar/causal-graphical

- **Predictive Maintenance Planning** — tiny end-to-end demo (baseline, ROC-AUC, threshold policy)  
  ➜ https://github.com/soroush-akbarijokar/predictive-maintenance-planning

- **Adversarial Robustness in DL** — synthetic FGSM demo with clean/adv accuracy  
  ➜ https://github.com/soroush-akbarijokar/adversarial-robustness-dl

- **Ridge Regression for Time-Series (CMU 10-701)** — NumPy-only closed-form, Cholesky, and CG solvers; reproducible plots & metrics (coursework repo)
